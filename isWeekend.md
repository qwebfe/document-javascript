# Results in a boolean representation of a specific date.

Pass the specific date object firstly.
Use `Date.getDay()` to check weekend based on the day being returned as 0 - 6 using a modulo operation then return a boolean.

```js
const isWeekend = (t = new Date()) => {
  return t.getDay() % 6 === 0
}
```

```js
isWeekend() // 2018-10-19 (if current date is 2018-10-18)
```
